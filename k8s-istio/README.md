# Java (Spring Boot, Microprofile) or Node.js or Python + Istio on Kubernetes (GKE, AKS, EKS)

Testing Microservices on k8s cluter with Istio. We have already tested/implemented Microservices but the tooling is very rich and complex. So we want to find/use a solution simpler than before, and it seems that k8s/Istio is the messi for us. In a few words : simply manage microservices.

## Introduction

There are two different and super simple microservices in this system and they are chained together in the following sequence:

servicea â†’ serviceb

Each service has his implementation in Spring, Microprofile, Node.js and Python. You can deploy both of them in the cluster k8s/Istio.
